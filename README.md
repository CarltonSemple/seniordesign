# Surveillance & Apprehensive Security System (SASS)
Syracuse University Senior Design Project.

# System Description
SASS is designed to be a small-scale model of an autonomous mobile tracking system for security purposes. Using an Xbox 360 Kinect video camera, the system scans in a person to create a target object. After the scan is complete, two Parrot Jumping Sumo ground drones begin tracking the target with each drone assigned to a designated tracking area. An elevated Xbox One Kinect will provide assistance to the drones tracking their target. Only one drone will be actively tracking the target at a time while the other drone remains dormant, depending on if the person is currently located within each drone’s assigned area.

# System Components
SASS consists of both software and hardware. The following are the main components of the system:<br />
•	Xbox 360 & Xbox One Kinects <br />
•	Kinect adaptors <br />
•	2 Parrot Jumping Sumo ground drones <br />
•	Computer vision <br />
•	LG monitor <br />
•	Computers containing Linux OS <br />
•	Custom Networking architecture

# Future Applications
SASS gives potential for commercial and national defense mobile security systems. This system may be scaled upwards to be used domestically in metropolitan areas with dense populations. Store and mall security may be enhanced and completely automated. Abroad, this system may aid in national defense by locating and tracking enemies autonomously, removing the risk of putting soldiers in danger.

# Team Members
Jacob Soccorso <br />
Major: Computer Engineering <br />
Jacob (Jake) is from Foxboro, MA and has had two summer internships with BAE Systems. He was a member of the VEGS team, working on an airborne tactical radar system being used overseas. He has an interest in front-end software development and project management. He will begin work as a software engineer with BAE Systems in Burlington, MA upon graduation.

Carlton Semple <br />
Major: Computer Engineering <br />
Carlton's first professional experience was as an application developer intern at JPMorgan Chase. He then went on to be an Extreme Blue intern with IBM, creating the Supply Chain Cognitive Risk Management System that is now being expanded and offered as a real solution for clients. Carlton will be joining IBM Cloud as a software engineer upon graduation. He hopes to move into robotics and machine learning in the future.

Justin Villani <br />
